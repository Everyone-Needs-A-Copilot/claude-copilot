## Claude Copilot

This project uses [Claude Copilot](https://github.com/Everyone-Needs-A-Copilot/claude-copilot).

**Full documentation:** `~/.claude/copilot/README.md`

### Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/protocol` | Start fresh work with Agent-First Protocol |
| `/continue` | Resume previous work via Memory Copilot |
| `/setup-project` | Initialize Claude Copilot in a new project |
| `/knowledge-copilot` | Build or link shared knowledge repository |

### Capabilities

| Capability | Tools | Purpose |
|------------|-------|---------|
| **Memory** | `cc memory` | Persist decisions, lessons, progress across sessions |
| **Agents** | 15 framework agents + kc (setup-only) via `/protocol` | Expert guidance routed by task type |
| **Knowledge** | `knowledge_search`, `knowledge_get` | Search company/product documentation |
| **Skills** | `cc skill search`, `cc skill get`, `cc skill select` | Load expertise on demand; `select` returns a bounded, receipted set — see Optional Context below |

### Agents

| Agent | Domain |
|-------|--------|
| `ta` | Tech Architect - system design, task breakdown |
| `me` | Engineer - code implementation |
| `qa` | QA - testing, edge cases |
| `sec` | Security - vulnerabilities, OWASP |
| `doc` | Documentation - technical writing |
| `do` | DevOps - CI/CD, infrastructure |
| `sd` | Service Designer - customer journeys |
| `uxd` | UX Designer - interaction design |
| `uids` | UI Designer - visual design |
| `uid` | UI Developer - component implementation |
| `cw` | Copywriter - microcopy, voice |
| `cco` | Creative Director - brand strategy, art direction, creative concepts |
| `ind` | Industrial Designer - essentialism, reduction, product-as-object |
| `cs` | Sales Advisor - sales strategy, pipeline, deal architecture |
| `kc` | Knowledge Copilot - shared knowledge setup |
| `cpa` | CPA Copilot - tax strategy, financial modeling, hiring economics |

### Configuration

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Memory | Workspace: `{{WORKSPACE_ID}}` |
| Knowledge | {{KNOWLEDGE_STATUS}} |
| Skills | Local: `.claude/skills/` {{EXTERNAL_SKILLS_STATUS}} |
| Output | Verbosity `{{OUTPUT_VERBOSITY}}`, audience `{{OUTPUT_AUDIENCE}}` — see `.claude/agents/_shared/output-contract.md`; change with `cc config set output.verbosity <concise\|standard\|detailed> --project` |

## Optional Context

Mandatory repository, project, and system instructions always apply. They are never
subject to relevance filtering and are never loaded through this step.

When the task needs knowledge beyond those instructions, load it once:

    cc skill select "<task topic>" --required <skill> --max-chars 12000 --json

Use the returned `selected[].content`. If you will not use it, do not load it.

Record the receipt once per task, not once per load:

    tc wp store --task <id> --type context --title "Context selection receipt" --file receipt.json

Keep `query`, `max_chars`, `loaded_characters`, `mandatory_over_budget`, and for every
entry in `selected` and `excluded` its `name`, `source`, `source_revision`,
`selection_reason` or exclusion `reason`. Do not re-store the content itself.

Before selecting again inside the same task, read that receipt. Skip any skill whose
`source_revision` you already hold. Reload only when the revision differs, and when it
does, record both revisions and say the source changed.

`mandatory_over_budget: true` means a `--required` skill was retained past the budget.
Report it: "Required context exceeded the `<max_chars>`-character budget by
`<loaded_characters - max_chars>` characters; retained in full." Never drop it to fit.

Character counts are not model tokens, and a receipt records selection, never proof
that content was read or obeyed.

**Visible fallbacks.** Name the one that applied, then continue:

- `cc` unavailable or non-zero exit: "Optional context unavailable (`cc skill select`
  failed: <stderr>); proceeding on repository instructions and prior memory only."
- Required skill not found (exit 2, `Required skill not found: <name>`): do not
  substitute a similar skill. State the missing name, then proceed without it — or emit
  `<promise>BLOCKED</promise>` if the task genuinely cannot proceed without it.
- No optional skill matched (`selected: []`): "No optional context matched '<query>';
  proceeding on repository instructions." Do not widen the query to manufacture a match.
- No knowledge repos configured (`CC_KNOWLEDGE_REPOS` empty): "Knowledge tier
  unconfigured; optional context limited to project and machine skills." Never block.

## Session Management

**Start:** `/protocol` - Activates Agent-First Protocol

**Resume:** `/continue` - Loads from Memory Copilot

**End:** Run `cc memory store` to persist key decisions and lessons from the session

## Knowledge Copilot

Knowledge Copilot is the single source of truth for brand, voice, offerings, and processes. Consult it first — never invent or duplicate this knowledge.

```bash
eval "$(cc env)"   # hydrates CC_KNOWLEDGE_REPO
```

| Domain | Path under `$CC_KNOWLEDGE_REPO` |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| Voice & tone | `01-company/02-voice/` |
| Brand & visual | `01-company/01-brand/` |
| Services & offerings | `01-company/03-services/` |
| Methodologies | `01-company/06-methodologies/` |
| Products | `02-products/` |

Full contract: `$CC_KNOWLEDGE_REPO/docs/00-knowledge-copilot/02-consumption-contract.md`

## Project-Specific Rules

### No Time Estimates
All plans, roadmaps, and task breakdowns MUST omit time estimates. Use phases, priorities, complexity ratings, and dependencies instead of dates or durations. See `~/.claude/copilot/CLAUDE.md` for full policy.
