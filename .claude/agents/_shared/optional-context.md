## Optional Context

Mandatory repository/project/system instructions always apply; never filter or load them here.

Load needed additional knowledge once; use `selected[].content` or do not load it:

    cc skill select "<task topic>" --required <skill> --max-chars 12000 --json

Record one receipt per task, not per load:

    tc wp store --task <id> --type context --title "Context selection receipt" --file receipt.json

Keep `query`, `max_chars`, `loaded_characters`, `mandatory_over_budget`; each
`selected`/`excluded` entry's `name`, `source`, `source_revision`, `selection_reason`
or `reason`, not content. Before reselection read the receipt; skip held revisions.
Reload only changes; record both revisions and announce the change.

Retain required skills in full if `mandatory_over_budget: true`; report `max_chars`
and overage `loaded_characters - max_chars`. Characters are not tokens; receipts
prove selection, not reading/obedience.

Keep every required name in `selected[]`; identical aliases have `duplicate_of`,
empty `content`, zero charged characters/bytes: use the selected entry named by
`duplicate_of`. Optional
duplicates stay `excluded[]` as `duplicate-content`.

**Visible fallbacks:** name the applicable one, then continue:

- `cc` absent/nonzero: report failure/stderr; use repository instructions and prior memory only.
- Exit 2, `Required skill not found: <name>`: name it, never substitute; proceed without it or emit `<promise>BLOCKED</promise>` if indispensable.
- `selected: []`: report no match for the query; use repository instructions, never widen the query to force a match.
- `CC_KNOWLEDGE_REPOS` empty: "Knowledge tier
  unconfigured; optional context limited to project and machine skills." Never block.
