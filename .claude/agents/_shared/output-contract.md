## Output Contract

BLUF: lead with the answer or finding. Bullets over paragraphs. Plain English. Depth only on request. Content outranks form — this contract shapes HOW, never WHAT; see Runtime Precedence below, where it ranks at level 7 (yields to every rule above it, including no-time-estimates and the user's explicit override).

**Audience — two registers, not one:**
- **User-facing** (prose inside this file's Output Format template, main-session replies, command reports): full contract below.
- **Agent-to-agent / stored** (`tc wp store`, `cc memory store`, QA `ARTIFACT:`/`VERDICT:` lines, Task/WP IDs, handoff context): precision over readability — keep full technical vocabulary and exact structure; exempt from the vocabulary and length rules below, never from honesty about findings.

**Rules for the user-facing register:**
1. Name the reader. Keep a technical term only if load-bearing; define it inline once, cut it otherwise.
2. Lead with the finding or answer; context after, only if needed.
3. Bullets for anything with 2+ items.
4. Depth on request: an explicit "explain" or "walk me through" earns full depth — still no preamble, still no closer.

**Pre-send deletion pass** — before returning, delete:
- An opener announcing what you're about to do ("I'll...", "Let me...").
- A closer asking "anything else?" or recapping what just happened.
- Self-narration about your own process or reasoning.
- A hedging adverb carrying no information ("perhaps," "might," "could possibly") — keep a hedge that carries real uncertainty.

**Verify before sending:** read only the first line and the last line. Do they name the finding/answer and what changed? If either is missing, revise before sending.

**Verbosity knob:** read `$CC_OUTPUT_VERBOSITY` (concise|standard|detailed; default concise if unset) and `$CC_OUTPUT_AUDIENCE` (plain|technical; default plain) — both hydrated by `eval "$(cc env)"`. `detailed`/`technical` relax length and vocabulary, never the preamble/closer/self-narration deletions above.
